VERSION: pdx-dk 1.1.9v1

This is a rewritte (from scratch) version of my pdx-dk theme! 
So there may still be some minor bugs. 
Found one? Tell me!

###########################################

This theme is for SMF 1.1.x 
It will cause problems on earlier versions 1.0.x!

Internet Explorer Limitations
___________________________________________

- none

IF USING A BOARD LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH:
___________________________________________

	You have to create "Modifications.YOUR_LANGUAGE.php" in the  languages directory of your pdx-dk theme.
	Do this by duplicating the  Modifications.english.php  of the languages directory of pdx-dk. Next, rename it 
	according to the language for which you use the file. Means replace YOUR_LANGUAGE in Modifications.YOUR_LANGUAGE.php
	with french, german, spanish...


COLORS:
___________________________________________

	PDX-DK comes in different color versions (at the moment: yellow, blue, green, red)
	and with a dark and light background.
	selectable via the admin interface. More colores may follow.

	Admin / Configuration / Current Theme / Main color of pdx-dk theme


LOGO:
___________________________________________

to get your own logo on the header you have two options:

	1.
		Use the option in the admin interface
		Admin / Configuration / Current Theme / Logo image URL
		This will completely replace the default logo AND the forum name.
		Check if the linked image (logo) has the right size!

	2.
		Use the provided logo_blank.png in the image folder as base for your own
		icon and replace the default logo.png.
		In this case the forum name will still be visible!

		Attention: Because this theme comes in a light and a dark version there are two logo images available!
		Check in images/light and images/dark 

EXTRA HOME BUTTON:
___________________________________________

	You are able to set a link back to your homepage in the main tabs. 
	If a url is set in the admin interface it gets assignt to the "home" button and a "forum" button replaces 
	the current "home" button.
